Dog Party - Mod 1
-----------------

The main focus of this project was to create two different and unique stylesheets that incorporate the same HTML file. In addition, this was an opportunity for me to practice writing the structure of both HTML and CSS. We were not supposed to use flexbox or grid on this project.

Process
-------
1. My first focus was to make sure each stylesheet matched the promp to the best of my ability. This was made challenging by the fact that the comp was clearly narrow image, which made my own page more narrrow to match.
2. I then implemented JavaScript in the form element. The user is able to type their dog's name and then it will update the main heading. Since it is attached to the HTML file, both versions of the website use this function.
3. I then tried to utilize the media queries to make the sites more responsive. I was able to set up the first option to shrink, however I think I would have built differently if I started this project with a plan to use media queries.
